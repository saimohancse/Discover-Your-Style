<p>We all know that we should get up off the couch and exercise more, but it’s hard to find the motivation when working out feels like a chore. While some people love feeling the burn at the gym or going for long runs, it’s fair to say that most of us mere mortals would rather be doing just about anything else. For that reason, it’s important to change the way you think about exercise, and instead of defining it ‘as a job that needs to be done’ or ‘another chore on the to-do list’- start seeing it as something fun! Finding the right activity can make exercising something enjoyable, it can be something you actually want to go out and do and you’ll burn calories and tone up your muscles without even thinking about it. Here are some ideas!</p>

<h3><strong>Go Back to Childhood</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about the kinds of activities you used to do as a child. Chances are, you had so much fun and were super active without thinking for a second about how healthy this was. Everything from riding bikes to jumping on a trampoline or bouncy castle, roller blading, ice skating or swimming are great activities. If you have kids yourself, these are all things you can do as a family that will benefit you all. One of the greatest joys of having children is getting to relive these fun youthful moments with them, and if it encourages you to all get healthy then even better.</p>

<p>Travelling to a new location to explore and enjoying a wonderful day trip will certainly allow you to get your steps in.

If you love travelling, book regular trips when you’re off work and use the time to explore. You’ll stimulate your brain and do plenty of walking and activity without even thinking about it. You will be much too busy taking it all in and having a good time.</p>
