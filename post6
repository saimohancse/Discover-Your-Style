<h3>How Does The Internet Of Things Work With Home Devices?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of the technology mentioned above has been made possible because of the Internet. New websites, platforms, and applications will continue to revolutionize the way we live our lives. However, the latest Internet technology isn’t always accessible on screens, and it’s called the Internet of Things (IoT). The Internet of Things allows everyday objects to be synced up to the Internet through Wi-Fi. This synching makes their usual functions accessible remotely and automated through data available on the world wide web. It may sound complicated, but it’s the same technology we’ve been using for years, just now accessible through different objects.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/iot-and-seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet of Things</a>&nbsp;can help to significantly improve aging in place and at-home safety, especially for seniors living with conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and arthritis. IoT devices are designed to monitor health at home, aid with mobility, and provide continuous monitoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some examples of objects that use IoT today include driverless cars, fitness trackers like Fitbit, thermostats, and doorbells. Objects that use IoT are also commonly referred to as smart objects (think of smart TVs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll use the example of a&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/nest-thermostat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart thermostat</a>&nbsp;to describe how it works. By connecting to the Internet, you’re able to use a smart thermostat remotely through your computer or smartphone. These systems usually have their own applications that you can open and control no matter where you are. For example, what if you’d like to cool the house down while you’re away? All you would have to do is open the smart thermostat app to tell it what to do.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because these devices are so “smart,” you usually don’t need to do much when using them. The sensors on these thermostats are specifically designed to optimize your home for energy efficiency. Once you set your desired temperature, the thermostat can work on its own to keep your home at the best temperature. The thermostat won’t waste energy by staying on longer than needed.</p>

<h3>Using Technology For Shopping</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you’re too busy or don’t want to leave home, online shopping is an easy way to buy what you need. You’re only a couple clicks away from getting the things you need thanks to the many options for online retail. There is no hassle and no need to make several trips to different stores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you aren’t as mobile as you used to be, online shopping makes it so everything you need can be delivered directly to your doorstep. While we still encourage as much daily exercise as possible, it can be too hectic and even hazardous sometimes for seniors to be out running so many errands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your average yard sale is even now online. With websites like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Craigslist</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Marketplace</a>, you can browse listings from people in your area. These are people who are looking to get rid of their used furniture, clothes, appliances, and more. Using these websites, you can view items based on what you need and your budget. Just like the technologies we listed above, these online marketplaces use secure payment methods that don’t require cash.</p>

<h3>Using Voice Assistants</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If smart devices seem overwhelming to you, there may be an easy solution: voice assistants. These include Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri. With a voice assistant, you can control all of the smart devices in your home and access the Internet by speaking voice commands. It’s as easy to use as having a conversation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to shopping, these devices allow you to create a shopping list out loud and then have it automatically transferred to your phone. This makes the whole process easier for seniors with mobility issues with writing or who would rather speak out loud than make a list on a phone. Many of these devices even integrate directly with online shops. With the&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/amazon-alexa-device-echo-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Alexa</a>,&nbsp;you can immediately make Amazon purchases without ever having to go online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make everything in your home easier to access, you can integrate your voice assistant with any smart device to make it accessible via your voice. If your home needs temperature adjusting or you want to turn some lights off, you can do it all through a series of simple voice commands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":4012} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://aginginplace.org/wp-content/uploads/voice_recognition-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Voice recognition for the elderly" class="wp-image-4012"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They’re also handy to have inside your home for one of the most basic uses of the Internet – finding information. All you need to do is ask your voice assistant a question, and it will give you an answer found online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most phones these days are also equipped with different versions of voice assistants. If you’re hesitant about purchasing a unique voice assistant device, try testing out the software that lives on your phone. You can ask it to set reminders and alerts through your phone without having to search through settings. For seniors,&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/voice-recognition-innovation-and-the-implications-for-seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voice recognition software</a>&nbsp;can significantly improve the ability to live independently by making everyday tasks easier, aiding with medication reminders, and simply providing a more accessible, intuitive way to use technology.</p>

<h3>Using Technology For Food Delivery</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of the technology we’ve already described helps make our lives easier by saving time and effort. Another example of this type of technology is food delivery. We all lead busy lives that could use some extra time. The ability to have things brought to your home is especially helpful for seniors or those with disabilities or sickness. One aspect of our lives that we often take for granted is the ability to head over to the grocery store.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Grocery Delivery</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Food delivery can come in many different forms. Currently, many mobile apps allow you to order delivery from your favorite restaurants. We’re not talking about your standard pizza delivery. These apps pay people just like you to pick up takeout almost anywhere. A few examples of these apps include&nbsp;<a href="https://postmates.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Postmates</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubereats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uber Eats</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doordash.com/?utm_source=google-sem-brand&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=CX_ACQ_US_NAXXXX_SE_SB_GO_100919_Search_Brand_National_Exact&amp;utm_term=door%20dash&amp;utm_content=67789639595&amp;kclickid=_k_EAIaIQobChMI1qLX8Ya45QIVBqSzCh3GygITEAAYASAAEgJy5_D_BwE_k_&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1qLX8Ya45QIVBqSzCh3GygITEAAYASAAEgJy5_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DoorDash</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of these same apps and others offer grocery delivery, such as Instacart and Shipt. A lot of grocery stores like Walmart, Target, and Kroger even offer delivery or pick-up options. The&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/best-grocery-delivery-plans-for-seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best grocery delivery plans for seniors</a>&nbsp;are helpful if you love to cook but can’t make it to the grocery store that often. It can also help if you find it difficult to leave the house but still want to make home-cooked meals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Meal Kit Delivery</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, you can also use subscription-based food delivery companies to get meals sent to your doorstep every week. These come in different forms. For example, companies like Blue Apron and HelloFresh deliver meal kits with all the ingredients for a set of recipes. It’s like getting customized groceries delivered with step-by-step instructions.&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/best-meal-kit-delivery-options-for-seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meal kits can help seniors</a>&nbsp;by cutting out a lot of the preparation needed to make a meal. You still might need to do a little additional cutting and preparing, but it won’t be as intensive as going to the grocery store and starting from scratch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Pre-Made Meal Delivery</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t cook, some companies that deliver pre-made meals. Some examples of these companies include Magic Kitchen, Silver Cuisine, and The Good Kitchen. While frozen tends to mean less nutritious, these companies have put a lot of time and research into developing delicious recipes. They still taste great after being reheated yet also contain the nutritional value for different needs, including vegetarians, people with diabetes, and seniors. These options remove the need for time-consuming grocery shopping and cooking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For seniors, it’s common to have particular nutritional needs as you age and start to live with deficiencies or conditions like diabetes.&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/best-prepared-meal-delivery-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senior meal delivery companies</a>&nbsp;make it easy to stay healthy without sacrificing your mobility or personal time.</p>

<h3>Using Technology In Transportation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Driverless Cars</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Driverless cars have been in development for years, but this technology has yet to become commonplace. When it does, it will lead to fewer accidents on the road. It will also make transportation more accessible to everyone.&nbsp; People will be able to use cars even if they have disabilities or live in areas without public transportation. Driverless cars will use sensors to understand when to brake, speed up, turn, and park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though this technology still has yet to be perfected, we’re already seeing examples of its early stages in most new cars today. Since the technology being used isn’t completely driverless yet, it’s called driver assist. Using cameras and sensors, this technology can help you park, detect blind spots, warn you if you’re merging into another lane, and even automate the entire parking process – even parallel parking.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Ride Sharing</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until the development of technology for driverless cars is ready, people will still be using planes, trains, and regular automobiles to travel. Technology has made some of these options more accessible. One of the most popular types of apps used today is for ride sharing. Popular ride sharing apps companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>. The technology in their apps allows people to hail a ride from anywhere, just like a taxi cab. The best part about these apps is that the driver is trackable from a GPS map. Rides are also accessible nearly everywhere, even in areas where there usually aren’t any taxis. The companies let everyday people with modern cars apply to become drivers. Once they pass a background test, they’re eligible to start giving rides through the app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people are hesitant to take rides from strangers. For your security, the apps have rating systems in place to ensure the drivers are doing their jobs well. The companies also continually update their security measures to make sure riders are safe.</p>

<h2>Technology Has Changed How We Stay Safe</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>For seniors or people with disabilities, IoT devices are some of the best technologies for keeping them safe at home.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best ways technology has changed our lives is in keeping us safer. Through technology, we’re living longer than ever before. While there have been countless technology advances in hospitals and medicine, there are also new technologies we can use at home. These enhance our everyday lives with safety and protection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>IoT Safety Devices</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For seniors or people with disabilities, IoT devices are some of the best technologies for keeping them safe at home. One great example is&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/medical-alert-systems/fall-detection/">fall detection technology</a>. Through wearables or floor and bed sensors, small devices are capable of knowing when someone falls. Once these sensors go off, caregivers are alerted through intercoms or mobile alerts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Home Security Systems</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smart security systems at home can also keep you safe from intruders. When these alarms go off, they can begin recording with a camera around your home and will also alert security professionals. These systems also connect to an app that you can access on your phone. You can view live footage of what’s going on in your home or disable alarms remotely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you aren’t interested in a full security system, you can also make a one-time purchase on a security camera or security doorbell like Ring Doorbell and Nest Camera. These require easy installation to your front door and work by providing direct notifications to your home when it senses someone’s there. There’s even an intercom built in so you can communicate with visitors and see them through the camera without having to open the door.</p>
