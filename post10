<p>A jacket or coat may be decorated with a print. In addition, flowers look great on bags, hats and scarves.&nbsp;Designers presented floral solutions with small and large floral motifs. In the summer, a white base is best for them, and in the cold season, on the contrary, black or dark palette variations.</p>

<h3>Stripe patterns in clothing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An alternative to animal stripes is the fashionable “seaman’s waistcoat”. The strip is now in fashion in each of its incarnations. If black and white lines alternate on a blouse, then it is quite possible to wear it even in the office. And speaking of rainbow stripes, this outfit is suitable for parties or a beach outfit.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple of seasons ago, the strip has already appeared on fashion shows in a vertical position. This season, it is better to choose clothes with horizontal stripes of medium and small size or a diagonal design.</p>
