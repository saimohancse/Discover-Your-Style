<p>Lifestyle has evolved to be a combination of various terminologies today. This one single word houses enormous components within it. In simple terms, lifestyle denotes the way we live our lives. Under this we count everything, from the coffee we drink to the clothes we wear. With its absolute amalgamation with technology, lifestyle has undergone a considerable transformation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back to the days when morning coffee was a ritual to enjoy individually, to the times when it is a new fancy to flaunt it in an electronic frother, lifestyle has changed leaps and bounds. The touch of technology can enhance anything, be it an experience or a reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, companies dealing with lifestyle products enjoy digital technology’s fantastic benefits (dynamic mobile applications and web solutions). Digitalization has helped the industry to create a new niche. It has helped numerous brands to increase their reach and enhance the recall value of their products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To know how technology has empowered lifestyle, let’s discuss it further in this blog.</p>

<h3><strong>Lifestyle Then and Now</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gone are the days when clothing was just a necessity; today, clothing is considered an extension of a personality. Hence, people and their clothing choice have changed. Not only clothing but also other lifestyle components like fashion, home decor, mental wellbeing, diet and nutrition have all created a responsive market for itself.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In doing so, technology has played a considerable part. It provided the lifestyle industry with a medium to extend its reach and establish its need. Social media, digital and influencer marketing can be excellent examples of the same.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology helped brands dealing with such solutions to revive the lost trends and promote traditional fashion with a new perspective. It further helped to take the trends from one region to another. For example, bohemian style and decor is a significant trend accepted by people of various countries.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, technology helped reach and grow fancy and nutritious edible items from one country to another. Oats, a staple grain of Africa, is actively promoted by dieticians globally, as adequate food for weight loss and management. There are many trending diets (promoted by bloggers and dieticians) based on food cooked using oats.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Likewise, traditional textile and fabrics which got lost due to synthetic materials got another entry into the market by graphical and digital promotions. All thanks to the new age fashion and lifestyle designers, who are well equipped with the technology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, it was only due to technology that online shopping can give a real-time shopping experience today. Initially, it was challenging for consumers to trust the authenticity of material purchased online. But superior customer support, dynamic user interactivity, and changing trends helped to achieve it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, technology-empowered the lifestyle industry by stepping out of its niche and catering to a broader market.</p>

<h3><strong>Creation of A New Sector</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Visiting down the memory lane, can we collect memories of terminologies like skincare, beauty regime, sleep monitors, health trackers, fitness apps, etc.? We might relate to some, but feeling all these to be prevalent in earlier times is difficult.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media and digital marketing gave beauty/wellness and health-related brands a fantastic platform. This platform helped brands dealing in these solutions to expand their markets and create an aspirational value amongst the consumers. Today, in the name of daily skin cream, the online and offline shelves are filled with an array of brands.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier creams were just considered a mere skin maintenance product, and people were only limited to <a href="https://www.nivea.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NIVEA</a>; today, skincare has turned out to be a massive industry. The humongous influencer marketing has helped skincare develop its own consumer base. All the skincare brands majorly work on a very famous advertising model called <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/AIDA.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIDA</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.nykaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nykaa</a>, a platform dedicated to selling beauty and wellness products, was a unique startup with this idea. It made full use of modern technologies like mobile application, web application, influencer marketing, covert advertising etc. <a href="https://www.beautybay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BEAUTY BAY</a>, <a href="https://www.glossybox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GlossyBox</a>, <a href="https://www.beautyexpert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beauty Expert</a> are also some good examples of the same.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The amalgamation of lifestyle and technology also created awareness for sustainability. Be it eco-friendly fabrics, recycling old clothes or using solar energy and rechargeable batteries, brands are promoting the same solutions. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank">Tesla</a> is a fantastic brand, which brings together technology, sustainability and style to offer dynamic solutions.&nbsp;</p>
