It’s incredible to look back and see how much easier communication has gotten over the years. Communication tools offer one of the most significant examples of how quickly technology has evolved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past, writing a letter, sending faxes, or finding a wired telephone was the best way to communicate remotely with someone. To connect with someone in society today, you have many more efficient options at your fingertips. You can send them a message on social media, text them, video chat, email, or put a call through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These new methods can help you keep in touch with loved ones, especially if you’re aging in place or living alone. Video chat helps caregivers check on seniors who may not need continual check-ups in person. Social media is a great way to keep in touch in general, allowing you to see what your loved ones are doing through the photos and updates they post.</p>

<h3>Social Media</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>The Evolution Of&nbsp;<a href="https://aginginplace.org/medical-alert-systems/">Medical Alert System Technology</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within the last decade, medical emergency response systems have seen some impressive advancements, both in terms of technology and in safety measures that have made seniors feel safer than ever before. One of the earliest and most important advancements has been the introduction of mobile medical alert systems. These systems allow users the freedom to leave their homes and live their normal lives, while still having the peace of mind that emergency help is available in case of an emergency. Several devices, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalguardian.com/help-me-choose/?aid=4540&amp;utm_source=AIP&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=medical-alert-systems-with-fall-detection-aip-l">Medical Guardian Mobile</a>&nbsp;2.0, allow users to set up a network of emergency contacts who can also view their whereabouts and be notified in case of an emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent advancements in medical alert technology also include a built-in fall detection feature. With this feature, special sensors in your medical alert pendant automatically detect when a fall occurs and send an alert to your monitoring call center. With new GPS and cellular technology, the operator can then determine where you fell, regardless of whether you can communicate your whereabouts or know the address. This technology allows the operators to then send emergency medical assistance to you more quickly, thus providing a great sense of security for yourself and your loved ones.</p>
