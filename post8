<p>In modern reality, a person is exposed to a variety of stresses and changes in the rhythm of life. After large-scale quarantine measures, during which we have learned to appreciate the convenience and comfort of everyday home clothes, when we go back to the offices, many face the problem of uncomfortable clothing.<br>Designers and large fashion houses in recent seasons have already helped to keep a person comfortable as a person, without losing the elegance of the image. A striking example is the collections of Balenciaga and Celine. Their concept is an example of an exaggerated combination of style and comfort. The rest did not go far either, more and more designers show comfortable dresses, and loose suits and the resumption of the trend of fitted silhouettes does not bother either.</p>

<p>In everyday life, many people gather in tracksuits, sneakers and silk pyjamas. Is it bad? Not at all! But in addition to the already-known schemes, many different combinations can create cosiness without limiting your style! In the article, we will talk about some of them.</p>

<p>Let’s start by saying that the need for comfort can depend on various factors: work, the fast pace of life, the shape of the style and, above all, the mental state. Therefore, the proposal for implementing the style of comfort may vary depending on various factors.</p>

<p>Office workers are the most exposed to stress. They are the ones who have to adhere to the established dress code. However, it should be noted that many companies have revised the conditions previously set and made compromises. One of them was the introduction of comfortable silhouettes while respecting the colour scheme.</p>

<p>What can be offered? Pants with a free cut, with tucks or with an elastic band, while not maintaining a sporty look, but closer to the classic. Various long-sleeved and basic T-shirts are good substitutes for tight blouses or, in extreme cases, the ever-popular straight-cut white shirts. If you want to add styling, accessories or layering techniques come to the rescue. For example, vests for T-shirts, a vest for a naked body under a jacket.</p>

<p>One of the most common and profound topics is the need for comfort due to psychological factors, where calmness, speed of thought and success in work processes depend on&nbsp;having&nbsp;a comfortable image.&nbsp;It is important&nbsp;to&nbsp;take into account ergonomic features, a person should be comfortable&nbsp;not&nbsp;only with the style but also with the material. On a hot day, synthetic materials&nbsp;are not&nbsp;always pleasant, just like in winter, someone can feel uncomfortable in a wool sweater.&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;your&nbsp;self-esteem and, if you want, make an “awkward”&nbsp;list&nbsp;where you specify taboos for your image.&nbsp;It is important&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand here&nbsp;that not everyone&nbsp;needs this, many sacrifice comfort for style.</p>
